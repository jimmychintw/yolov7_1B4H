# Step 3 Diff Analysis Report

## Date: 2025-09-02

## Summary:
- Lines added: {added_lines}
- Lines removed: {removed_lines}
- Net change: +{added_lines - removed_lines} lines

## Changes Made:
- Added MultiHeadDetect class after Detect class
- No modifications to existing code
- Only additions at the end of file

## Risk Assessment:
- Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM
- New class is isolated
- Uses placeholder Identity() modules for now
- No functional implementation yet

## Verification:
- [✓] Original Detect class unchanged
- [✓] No import conflicts  
- [✓] File structure preserved
- [✓] Can create MultiHeadDetect instance
- [✓] Compatible attributes present

## Test Results:
- test_step3_multihead_detect_init.py: PASSED
  - Original Detect intact
  - MultiHeadDetect imported successfully
  - All attributes correct
  
- test_step3_no_regression.py: PASSED
  - No regressions detected
  - Original functionality preserved

## Status: COMPLETED ✅
